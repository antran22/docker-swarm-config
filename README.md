# Docker Swarm Config

This repo contains some ready to use configurations for deploying popular open source applications on a Docker Swarm cluster. 
A small [script](./deploy-docker-swarm.sh) is included to help you deploy applications quickly.

This is heavily inspired by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo)'s [Docker Swarm Rocks](https://dockerswarm.rocks/). Big shout out to the man.
